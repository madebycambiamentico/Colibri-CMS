# Colibri-CMS
lightweight and fast CMS based on SQLite 3

This is a really simple CMS based on a portable database: SQLite.
It features a custom file manager, simple and clean administration UI, and, most of all, incredible speed.

It is in its early development, so some features are not yet implemented. One day they will be!

- multilanguage support for generated web-pages
- wiki
- clean scripts

- automatized site setup
- modular admin software, so themes can dynamically change editor contents without open a dedicated administration page
