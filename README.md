# Colibri-CMS
lightweight and fast CMS based on SQLite 3

This is a really simple CMS based on a portable database: SQLite.
It features a custom file manager, simple and clean administration UI, and, most of all, incredible speed.
From version 0.2 it comes with a very basic multilanguage site support.

It is in its early development, so some features are not yet implemented. One day they will be!

# Roadmap
- multilanguage admin interface
- wiki
- clean scripts
- tests
- automatized site setup
- modular admin software, so themes can dynamically change editor contents without open a dedicated administration page
